# Complete GitHub Push Instructions

I've already set up Git locally for your project. To finish uploading to GitHub:

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Create a new repository:
   - Name: `ai-companion-chatbot`
   - Description (optional): "A modern AI companion platform built with Next.js"
   - Make it Public or Private as you prefer
   - Don't add README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

3. Copy the repository URL displayed (should look like `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ai-companion-chatbot.git`)

4. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run the following commands:

```
cd C:\Users\PC\ai-companion-chatbot

"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe" remote set-url origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL

"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe" push -u origin main
```

Replace YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL with the URL you copied in step 3.

5. When prompted, enter your GitHub username and password (or personal access token if you have 2FA enabled)

That's it! Your code will now be on GitHub, and you can share the repository URL with your friend.
