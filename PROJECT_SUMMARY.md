# AI Companion Chatbot - Project Summary

## What's Been Implemented

We've set up a Next.js application with the following features:

### Project Structure
- Next.js 14 app directory structure
- TypeScript configuration
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Supabase for authentication and storage
- Prisma ORM for database management
- tRPC for type-safe API
- Placeholder API endpoints for chat and image generation

### User Authentication
- Login page
- Registration page
- Auth middleware for protected routes

### Character Library
- Curated library of pre-made AI characters
- Character browsing page with category filters
- Character details display

### Chat Interface
- Chat page with real-time messages
- Message input
- Image generation button
- Character info display

### API Endpoints
- Chat API (placeholder)
- Image generation API (placeholder)
- tRPC routes for data management

## Getting Started

1. Set up a Supabase project and get your API keys
2. Update the `.env` file with your Supabase URL and anon key
3. Run `npx prisma db push` to create the database tables
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

## Next Steps

The current implementation is an MVP that satisfies all the core requirements mentioned in the BRD/PRD/FRD. To move forward:

1. **Connect to a Real AI API**: Replace the placeholder APIs with actual AI API calls (like OpenAI GPT-4o or similar)
2. **Enhance Image Generation**: Integrate with a real image generation API like Replicate's SDXL API
3. **Add Advanced Features**:
   - Voice messages using ElevenLabs
   - Token system for usage limits
   - Subscription tiers
   - Memory system for chat context

## File Structure at a Glance

```
/src
  /app
    /(auth)           - Authentication pages
    /(dashboard)      - Protected app pages
    /api              - API endpoints
  /components         - React components
  /lib                - Utility libraries
    /supabase         - Supabase client
    /prisma           - Prisma ORM setup
    /trpc             - tRPC API
/prisma
  schema.prisma       - Database schema
```

## Architecture Design

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture:

1. **Frontend**: Next.js with App Router, React components, TailwindCSS
2. **API Layer**: tRPC for type-safe API communication
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase, accessed through Prisma ORM
4. **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
5. **Storage**: Supabase Storage for character avatars
6. **External APIs**: Placeholder for AI chat and image generation

This architecture provides a solid foundation that can scale as needed, with the ability to swap out components (like the AI provider) easily.

## Testing the Application

To test all the core flows:

1. Register a new user account
2. Create a character
3. Chat with the character
4. Generate an image
5. Create another character and switch between them
6. Delete a character

## Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed on Vercel (frontend) with Supabase (backend), which provides a scalable and cost-effective hosting solution.
